## 🚀 Features

- 🎶 **Dynamic pitch control** based on your character’s view angle
- 🔢 **Realistic harmonic series** modeled after a true bugle
- 🎺 **Valve inputs** expand your range, enabling full chromatic capability
- 🌐 **Multiplayer support** allows every note you play to be heard exactly as intended
- 📈 Real-time **harmonic guide** overlay for performance and learning
- 📡 Smooth **network sync** using *Photon*, with minimal bandwidth usage

## 🔧 How It Works

*Virtuoso* maps traditional brass playing mechanics to intuitive in-game controls:

- 🎯 Look up or down to choose your pitch — each vertical angle corresponds to a harmonic partial in the brass series. Use default key `V` to toggle the UI.
- 🎼 Tilt slightly left or right to bend your pitch — perfect for vibrato, glides, and emotional expressiveness.
- 🎺 Use valve key combinations to simulate trumpet fingering, expanding your playable range. By default:
  - `C` for valve 1
  - `X` for valve 2
  - `Z` for valve 3

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I play real songs with this?**  
A: Yes! *Virtuoso* emulates real bugle and trumpet playing. Check out [How It Works](#-how-it-works) to learn more.

**Q: Do other players hear what I'm playing?**  
A: Yes! For other players with the mod, pitch and expression are fully synchronized across the network using a custom *Photon* integration.

**Q: Can I form a band with my buddies?**  
A: You can! Each player can grab a bugle and jam in perfect sync. Try out [*PocketBugle*][pocket] for an easy way to get started — spawn your own bugle anytime and start tooting together.
